# Game615Final

Final Project Assignment for Game 615 - Game Development I

created by Chenhao Ma, Jiachen Tang as a group

Additional Notes:
1. This assignment is done on Windows system. Sometimes the speed on Windows and macbook seems to have great difference. Players can modify the speed setting using Unity editor directly (all of them are set as public variables).
2. We failed to realize a pop-up window to tell players the result when time countdown finished.
